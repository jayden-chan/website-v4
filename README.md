# website

My personal website. Built with React and rendered into static HTML/CSS by a naive static
site generator implementation. I did this mainly because I was curious about
experimenting with static site generators, it's not the most optimal solution of course.

Installing
```
git clone https://github.com/jayden-chan/website
npm install
```

Building
```
npm run build
```

The static site is now built at `/build`
